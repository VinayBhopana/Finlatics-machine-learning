# Finlatics Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning projects completed as part of the Finlatics program. It includes data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization techniques applied to **sales prediction** and **Facebook Marketplace engagement** datasets.

## Datasets
- **Sales Prediction Dataset**: Contains advertising data used to predict sales based on different marketing channels.
- **Facebook Marketplace Dataset**: Includes user interactions such as likes, shares, and reactions to analyze engagement patterns.

## Project Descriptions
### 1. Sales Prediction
- **Goal**: Predict sales based on advertising expenditure.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Linear Regression for sales prediction
  - Data visualization (scatter plots, regression line)
  - Model evaluation using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Files**:
  - `Sales_Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and visualization
  - `advertising_sales_data.xlsx` - Dataset used for training and testing
  - `Sales Prediction Dataset.pptx` - Presentation summarizing findings

### 2. Facebook Marketplace Analysis
- **Goal**: Identify correlations between different engagement metrics.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships
  - Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- **Files**:
  - `Facebook_Marketplace.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with data analysis and visualizations
  - `Facebook_Marketplace_data.csv` - Dataset containing engagement metrics
  - `Facebook Marketplace Dataset.pptx` - Presentation summarizing insights



## Results
- **Sales Prediction Model** achieved a good correlation between advertising spend and sales.
- **Facebook Marketplace Analysis** identified key engagement factors affecting user interactions.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) for better predictions.
- Extend EDA to uncover deeper insights into user behavior.
